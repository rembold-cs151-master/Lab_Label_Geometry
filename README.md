# Lab 6: Label Geometry

Today's lab is playing around with `GLabel`s in the PGL library. Ideally, by the end, you will feel comfortable
- creating labels
- adjusting the font and sizing of labels
- centering labels
- and visualizing the baseline, ascent, and descent of labels.

Output from today's lab is purely visual, so no autochecking is happening. Just compare what you have to the shown image in the guide!
